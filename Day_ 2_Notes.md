## Day 2: Conditionals - if, else, elif

## ðŸ“š Topics Learned:
- Python `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements
- Control flow and how decisions are made in a program
- Using comparison and logical operators in conditions
- Nested conditions and combining conditions using `and`, `or`

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways:
- `if` checks a condition and executes a block of code if it's True
- `else` runs when the `if` condition is False
- `elif` allows multiple conditions to be checked in sequence
- Nesting `if` inside another `if` helps solve more complex logic
- Conditions can be written as:
  ```python
  if condition:
      # do something
  elif another_condition:
      # do something else
  else:
      # fallback action

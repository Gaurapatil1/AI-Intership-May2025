# Day 1: Python Basics

## 1. What is Python?
- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
- Easy to read and write.
- Used in web development, data science, AI, automation, etc.

## 2. Syntax and Comments
- Python uses indentation to define blocks (no `{}` like in C/C++).
- Comments start with `#`.

python
# This is a comment
print("Hello World")  # Inline comment


## 3. Variables and Data Types
- No need to declare the type of variable.
- Common data types: int, float, str, bool
 name = "Alice"      # str
 age = 20            # int
 price = 19.99       # float
 is_student = True   # bool

## 4. Input and Output
- input() takes user input as string.
- print() displays output.
  name = input("Enter your name: ")
  print("Hello", name)


## 5. Operators
- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
- Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
 a = 10
 b = 3
 print(a + b)  # 13
 print(a // b) # 3 (floor division)
 print(a % b)  # 1 (modulo)

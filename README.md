# 100 Days of Code â€“ Python (Basic to Advanced) with Data Structures & Algorithms
# Day 1: Python Basics

## ðŸ“š Topics Learned:
- Python introduction and syntax
- How to declare variables
- Taking input from user and printing output
- Basic arithmetic and comparison operators
- Understanding data types

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways:
- Python is dynamically typed â€“ no need to declare types.
- Use `input()` for input and `print()` for output.
- `int()`, `float()` help convert input types.
- Learn to use operators correctly for math problems.

## ðŸ§ª Programs Practiced:
- Greet user with their name
- Basic calculator using two inputs
- Type checking of variables

## ðŸ“Œ Next Up (Day 2):
- Control flow: `if`, `else`, `elif`
- Practice conditional problems

## ðŸ“š Topics Learned:

- Python if, else, elif statements

- Control flow and logical conditions

- Nested conditions


## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways:

- if checks a condition and executes code only if it's True

- else provides an alternative when if fails

- elif helps handle multiple conditions clearly

- Conditions can be chained and nested to solve real-world logic


## ðŸ§ª Programs Practiced:

1. Check if a number is even or odd

2. Find the largest of two numbers

3. Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero

4. Leap year checker

5. Grading system based on marks

6. Simple login system (with hardcoded values)

7. Mini calculator using if-elif-else


## ðŸ“Œ Next Up (Day 3):

Loops: for, while, range()

Practice loop-based problems

Print patterns

Factorials

Prime number checker

Sum of digits

# 100 Days of Code: Python + DSA (Basic to Advanced)

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge!  
This journey includes learning Python from scratch in 7 days, followed by solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from Arrays to Graphs, and building real projects.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Python Basics (Day 1 – Day 7)

### Day 1: Python Introduction + Setup
- Install Python, VS Code/Jupyter
- Print statements, variables, input/output

### Day 2: Data Types & Operators
- Numbers, Strings, Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Type casting, Operators

### Day 3: Conditional Statements & Loops
- if, elif, else
- while, for loops, range()

### Mini Project: Student Info & Marks Analyzer (Day 1–3)

**What it does:**
- Takes student details and marks as input.
- Calculates total, percentage, grade.
- Displays passed/failed subjects.
- Shows a star pattern as a performance badge.

**Concepts Used:** Input/output, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, string formatting.

**Code:** See [`student_analyzer.py`](Day_1,2,3_Program.py)

# Day 4: Functions & Recursion
- def keyword, return values
- Recursive functions
## Practice Problems Solved

- Greet a user
- Find max of 3 numbers
- Factorial of a number using recursion
- Fibonacci series using recursion
- Palindrome checker


### Day 5: Strings and List Operations
- Slicing, methods, comprehensions
- Nested lists

### Day 6: File Handling & Exception Handling
- Read/write files
- try, except, finally

### Day 7: OOP in Python + Practice
- Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Constructors
- Solve basic Python problems on LeetCode/HackerRank
